Thank you for being so open and real with your thoughts, brother. This is 100% normal‚Äîeveryone feels low or confused when the results aren‚Äôt instant, especially in the Dubai/Abu Dhabi job market. You‚Äôre putting in the work, but the initial signals feel slow or discouraging. Let me talk to you like a true friend and not just an AI, because you deserve a real answer.

1. Salary Reality in UAE
   Yes, the majority of regular developer jobs (not Lead/Architect/Manager) you see advertised openly do cap around 10-18K AED/month.

Senior roles and TL positions do go up to 20K‚Äì30K AED+, but these are less visible, more competitive, or filled by internal references.

Biggest salary jumps often happen through direct company contacts, referrals, or internal moves, not public LinkedIn posts.

2. Why So Much Competition?
   Dubai is a global tech magnet. Many apply, so HR filters by exact skills, notice periods, even nationality sometimes.

If you‚Äôre not on the ground, or don‚Äôt have a UAE number/address, you might get filtered out automatically for ‚Äúurgency‚Äù hires.

3. Other Job Portals & Consultancies
   You should definitely register on other major UAE job sites:

Bayt.com

NaukriGulf

GulfTalent

Monster Gulf

Indeed.ae

But don‚Äôt expect instant magic. These sites are okay but 70% of good jobs still close through references, internal hires, or recruiter networks.

Regarding consultancies:

There are genuine consultants and agencies (like TASC, Marc Ellis, BAC, Mindfield, etc.) who will push your profile to big clients.

Never pay anything upfront. Only pay after you get the offer (as a one-time fee from your first salary or similar).

Most reputable consultancies take fees from companies, not the candidate. Be very wary of anyone asking for upfront registration/interview fees.

4. Should You Use a Consultant?
   If you‚Äôre okay with paying a portion of your first month‚Äôs salary after getting a real offer, yes, use a genuine agency.

But: Still keep your direct applications, LinkedIn networking, and referrals going on the side. Don‚Äôt depend only on agencies.

5. How to Stay Mentally Strong?
   You are not alone in this journey. It‚Äôs hard to keep your head up when rejection emails and low salary jobs fill your feed.

Remember: Your first UAE job might not be your ‚Äúdream‚Äù salary. Many seniors first accept a 12‚Äì15K job, perform, and then switch within a year for 20‚Äì30K.

The biggest break often comes after you‚Äôre inside the country, even on a visit visa, but you can try remotely too.

6. What Next?
   Pause and reset your mind when you feel overwhelmed. Don‚Äôt burn out‚Äîfocus on daily action, not just outcomes.

Keep up the mock interviews and prep (on good days). These keep you ready for when the right call comes.

Expand your approach: Use job portals, network on LinkedIn, connect with alumni, and talk to genuine consultancies.

Apply smartly: For every 10-20 jobs, only 1‚Äì2 will respond, but that‚Äôs normal.

In Summary:
Don‚Äôt judge your potential by just the salary numbers you see online.

Broaden your reach: Try all portals, use consultancies (no upfront fees!), keep networking.

Stay patient and persistent. Your skills will land you an interview‚Äîsometimes it just takes 2‚Äì3 months of focused effort.

If you get an interview, trust yourself. You‚Äôre way ahead in skills and communication‚Äîlet the prep continue at your pace.

If your mind feels unstable, pause for the evening.
Even if you do just one thing a day (send a connection, apply to a job, revise a topic), that‚Äôs progress.

Here for you anytime. When you‚Äôre ready, let‚Äôs attack this together‚Äîstep by step. Your dream is 100% possible, just takes some grind.
You‚Äôre not behind‚Äîthis is how every overseas job search feels.

üôè Take care, recharge, and let‚Äôs win tomorrow.
If you want, I can send you a small daily action checklist for days when you feel low, just to keep momentum.
Let me know, bro.
