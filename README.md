# React Interview Preparation

This repository contains my React.js interview preparation materials, including:

- Custom hooks (e.g., useDebounce)
- Component mini-features (Show/Hide Password, Load More, etc.)
- JavaScript practice problems and solutions
- Notes and explanations

This repo is a work in progress and is updated regularly as part of my learning journey.
